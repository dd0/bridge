## Conventions and systems

* [Defensive conventions](defence.html) -- conventions for defence
  against strong 1!C, multi 2!D and some bidding after opponents
  double our openings.

* [EHAA](ehaa.html) -- a short summary of the "Every Hand an
  Adventure" system.

* [Simple 1!N](transfer.html)<sup>SR</sup> -- basic conventions after
  a 1!N opening (promissory Stayman, Jacoby transfers).

* [Weak two-bids](weaktwo.html) -- weak, natural two-level preempts, with
  Ogust as the 2!N response.
