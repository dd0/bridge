# Weak Two-Bids

All suit openings on the two level, except 2!C ^[The strong (20+ HCP)
bid.], are weak and natural. They show a preemptive holding, with a
decent six-card suit, and insufficient points to open with a
constructive (one-level) bid.

The quality of the opened suit varies with position and vulnerability
-- third-seat openings are the lightest, and second- and (especially)
fourth-seat bids are more sound. Playing green against red, a
third-seat 2!S opening with only a jack ^[Sometimes even a good
five-card suit.] is possible.

Raises are only non-forcing bids. All other suit bids are natural and
forcing for one round, and 2!N is an artificial asking bid. A raise to
game is two-way, made either with a strong hand that expects to make
or furthering the preempt.

* 2!H -- weak-two (6+!H, 11- HCP)
    * 2!S -- 5+!S, forcing
        * 3!H -- no !S support
	* 3!S -- 3+!S
    * 2!N -- 14+ HCP (_Ogust_)
    * 3!C -- 5+!C, forcing
    * 3!D -- 5+!D, forcing
    * 3!H -- to play
    * 4!H -- to play (two-way ^[Note that, unlike 4!H and 4!S, 2!D --
      4!D is always preemptive.])

## Ogust

The 2!N response to a weak-two bid asks opener to describe his
strength and suit quality. After opener describes his hand, responder
can make a decision to sign off in opener's suit or 3!N, or
alternatively bid a natural suit (showing six cards and a very strong
hand ^[This is not very useful with the structure described above. It
would be much better to have new suits after a weak-two as moderately
strong (14-16 HCP) but non-forcing, but the system currently says that
they are forcing.].

* 2!H -- 2!N (_Ogust_, 16+ HCP)
    * 3!C -- one !H honour, no extra values ^["Extra values" meaning a
      side-suit honour.]
    * 3!D -- two !H honours, no extra values
    * 3!H -- one !H honour, extra values
    * 3!S -- two !H honours, extra values
    * 3!N -- AKQ in !H ^[Responder should not expect any extra values,
      since opener would have bid 1!H otherwise.]
