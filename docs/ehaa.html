<h1>Every Hand An Adventure</h1>

<p>Every Hand An Adventure is a natural, agressive bidding system. It is
a four-card major system whose main features are a mini (10-12 HCP)
notrump and obligatory two-level preempts in all four suits.</p>

<p>Since 2<font color=green>&clubs;</font> is a preempt, there is no forcing opening bid. This means
that 2N openings are often semi-balanced (and sometimes unbalanced)
and that bidding very strong opening hands may be impossible. This is
by design &ndash; in an average tournament, the strong 2<font color=green>&clubs;</font> might be opened
once (or never), and the preemptive version is much more
common. Sacrificing the ability to bid a slam for several distruptive
openings can be favourable at matchpoints<a class="footnote" name="footnote1"><sup>1</sup><span>At IMPs, playing EHAA is
probably not a good idea.</span></a>,</p>

<h2>Mini 1N</h2>

<p>The 1N opening promises a balanced hand with 10-12 HCP. It usually
denies a five-card suit &ndash; such hands can open either one- or two of
that suit. The exception is a 5-3-3-2 hand, with five cards in a minor
and values concentrated in the short suits.</p>

<p>2<font color=green>&clubs;</font> is non-promissory Stayman, with the standard meaning and response
structure.</p>

<p>Responder can bid a five-card suit to try to improve the contract (3<font color=green>&clubs;</font>
with clubs, two-level with anything else). This is non-constructive
and the opener is expected to pass.</p>

<p>With 5-5 in the minors, responder bids 2N, after which opener chooses
his better minor. Responder can pass or invite game by raising.</p>

<p>All responses at the three level (except 3<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, which is a
non-constructive attempt at improving the contract) are preemptive,
showing at least six cards and not promising any values.</p>

<ul>
<li>1N &ndash; balanced<a class="footnote" name="footnote2"><sup>2</sup><span>4-3-3-3 or 4-4-3-2, rarely 5-3-3-2.</span></a>, 10-12 HCP
<ul>
<li>2<font color=green>&clubs;</font> &ndash; non-promissory Stayman
<ul>
<li>...</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2<font color=orange>&diams;</font> &ndash; 5+<font color=orange>&diams;</font>, to play</li>
<li>2<font color=red>&hearts;</font> &ndash; 5+<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, to play</li>
<li>2<font color=blue>&spades;</font> &ndash; 5+<font color=blue>&spades;</font>, to play</li>
<li>2N &ndash; 5+<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, 5+<font color=orange>&diams;</font>
<ul>
<li>3<font color=green>&clubs;</font> &ndash; <font color=green>&clubs;</font> preference</li>
<li>3<font color=orange>&diams;</font> &ndash; <font color=orange>&diams;</font> preference</li>
</ul></li>
<li>3<font color=green>&clubs;</font> &ndash; 5+<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, to play</li>
<li>3<font color=orange>&diams;</font> &ndash; preemptive, 6+<font color=orange>&diams;</font></li>
<li>...</li>
<li>3N &ndash; only constructive bid except 2<font color=green>&clubs;</font> and higher notrump bids</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Weak twos</h2>

<p>Any two of a suit opening<a class="footnote" name="footnote3"><sup>3</sup><span>Note that this includes 2<font color=green>&clubs;</font>.</span></a> shows 6-11
HCP and at least five cards in that suit. These openings are
<em>obligatory</em> &ndash; the opener must not pass with a hand that fits this
description. Therefore, passing an opening shows either a balanced
hand (with less than 12HCP) or at most five HCP.</p>

<p>The wide range of points and shapes that the opener might have makes
bidding game precisely impossible. Sometimes, a responder with a
decent hand will not be able to try for game<a class="footnote" name="footnote4"><sup>4</sup><span>For example, with 13
HCP, game might be possible if opener is maximal, but opposite a
minimum it is easy to get into a bad penalty.</span></a>.</p>

<p>Non-jump bids in new suits are non-constructive, non-forcing attempts
to improve the contract. They are generally made holding at least four
cards more in that suit than in the opener's. Over an overcall, these
show values and are constructive (but still non-forcing).</p>

<p>With an invitational hand, responder can raise or bid 2N (depending
on whether he has support). Jump bids in new suits are natural and
game-forcing. Because of the wide point range opener can have, these
bids are necessarily slam tries if he holds a maximum.</p>

<p>A jump to game in opener's suit<a class="footnote" name="footnote5"><sup>5</sup><span>Both 2<font color=red>&hearts;</font>&ndash;4<font color=red>&hearts;</font> and 2<font color=green>&clubs;</font>&ndash;5<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, but not
2<font color=green>&clubs;</font>&ndash;4<font color=green>&clubs;</font>, which is always preemptive.</span></a> is two-way, either preempting
the opponents with a weak hand or expecting to make. Opener is
expected to pass.</p>

<ul>
<li>2<font color=orange>&diams;</font> &ndash; 6-11 HCP, 5+<font color=orange>&diams;</font>
<ul>
<li>2<font color=red>&hearts;</font> &ndash; <font color=red>&hearts;</font> length, non-constructive, NF</li>
<li>2<font color=blue>&spades;</font> &ndash; <font color=blue>&spades;</font> length, non-constructive, NF</li>
<li>2N &ndash; 14-17 HCP, no <font color=orange>&diams;</font> support</li>
<li>3<font color=green>&clubs;</font> &ndash; <font color=green>&clubs;</font> length, non-constructive, NF</li>
<li>3<font color=orange>&diams;</font> &ndash; 14-17 HCP, 3+<font color=orange>&diams;</font></li>
<li>3<font color=red>&hearts;</font> &ndash; 5+<font color=red>&hearts;</font>, game-forcing</li>
<li>3<font color=blue>&spades;</font> &ndash; 5+<font color=blue>&spades;</font>, game-forcing</li>
<li>3N &ndash; to play</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Higher preempts</h2>

<p>Hands that can be opened at the two level should generally not be
opened below game. Therefore, all three-level preempts (4<font color=green>&clubs;</font> and 4<font color=orange>&diams;</font> as
well) are very weak, showing at most 5 HCP and at least six cards when
non-vulnerable and seven when vulnerable<a class="footnote" name="footnote6"><sup>6</sup><span>Seven and eight respectively
for 4<font color=green>&clubs;</font> and 4<font color=orange>&diams;</font>.</span></a>. The number of losers they promise depends on
vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unfavourable: five or six losers</li>
<li>Both vulnerable: six or seven losers</li>
<li>Neither vulnerable: seven or eight losers</li>
<li>Favourable: eight or nine losers<a class="footnote" name="footnote7"><sup>7</sup><span>For all of these, 4<font color=green>&clubs;</font> and 4<font color=orange>&diams;</font> show one loser less.</span></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Game-level preempts follow the same guidelines for suit length and
number of losers, but may be made on hands that can open with a
weak-two bid.</p>

<h2>One of a suit</h2>

<p>EHAA is a four-card major system, and one-level openings promise at
least four cards in the suit opened and at least 13 HCP. Conventional
responses can be used after these, including Jacoby 2N and Bergen
raises after major-suit openings (promising a good four-card or any
five-card support).</p>

<p>Notrump rebids show 13-15 HCP for a non-jump, 16-18 for a jump to NT
and 19-20 for a direct 3N rebid.</p>
